Dazzling has a seamless Docs feature (will be generated by default) so that can keep your docs in your project's root while having it pulled, formatted, and generated as a clean documentation website for your users.


## Editing Content

Here's how Dazzling treats your project layout:

```
my-project/
  src/      <--- your code
  content/
    docs/   <--- Markdown content
  www/      <--- Dazzling
```

Here's a sample document, in markdown (you get default docs to play with):

```markdown
---
title: Configuration
doc: 2
section: 1
category: "tech"
type: "doc"
---

Dazzling places your website configuration in `site-config.js`. This is where you personalize all asprects of the Dazzling website, without taking advantage of building new features in React (we'll get to that!).
```

`title` is both a title and a slug, so that if you choose "Getting Started" it will be converted to a `getting-started` slug that you can use to hotlink other documentation areas.

`section` and `doc` are numeric index values for the number of section and the document in the hirarchy of sections and documents, all starting from the index `1` (*not* zero based).

As you'll see the menu will be generated automatically based on how you decide to order your docs and sections.

The `category` and `type` fields are reserved for later use.

## Naming Sections

Edit `content/docs/sections.json` to name your various sections.

## Search

If you want full-text search, you got it. [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) offers a free acount to open source projects, and Dazzling supports only that provider (pull requests for more providers are welcome!).

After you create a new account it's just a matter of plugging the Algolia configuration into your `site-config.js`:


```js
docSearch: {
    apiKey: 'xxxxxx',
    indexName: 'fixme',
    inputSelector: '#algolia-doc-search',
    debug: false // Set debug to true if you want to inspect the dropdown
},
```
